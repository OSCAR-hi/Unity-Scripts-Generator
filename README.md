**Disclaimer:** This tool was not originally developed by me. However, due to my strong interest in artificial intelligence and game development, I analyzed the source code to understand its logic, learned how to communicate between Unity and the LLM API, and explored methods for creating a Unity Editor UI. Additionally, I added comments to help other Unity developers interested in AI learn from it.
